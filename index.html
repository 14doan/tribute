                        To also beautify the inner structure of a product. This lead to him to explore for his own inner mechanism. 
                        So he experienced with LSD and went on a spiritual journey to India. When asked about what he learned there, he replied "intuition".
                        Intuitively, he knew he didn't have much time on earth.
